# complex.java
Creating a class that represents complex numbers as a pair of double values. For this project, we are concerned mainly with the arithmetic and algebraic properties of complex numbers. 

The program will prompt the user to enter the degree of the polynomial, the coefficients, and the left and right endpoints of the interval in which to search. For example, to find the roots of the cubic polynomial x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x -6 in the interval [-10, 10], your program would run as follows:

% java Roots
Enter the degree: 3
Enter 4 coefficients: -6 11 -6 1
Enter the left and right endpoints: -10 10
Root found at 1.00000
Root found at 2.00000
Root found at 3.00000
